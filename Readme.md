# TreeChoppa

Spigot/Paper plugin for Minecraft which allows players to insta-chop trees using axes enchanted with Curse of Vanishing.
Leaves decay quickly for trees chopped with the specialized axes.

Plugin only applies if logs broken have non-persistent leaves adjacent to the trunk.

Additional, only applies if players are in survival mode.
